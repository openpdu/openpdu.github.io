# What is the OpenPDU project

OpenPDU is an OpenHardware and OpenSource project for a network-connected PDU.

The goal is to build a modular system than can be used to retrofit an existing 19" rack PDU to a real networked PDU.

A secondary goal is the use of commonly available hardware, where possible.

The project will support a wide variety of hardware configurations, ranging from "a bunch of boards bought from chinese manufacturers" to a well-designed open-hardware board. So it'll be possible to build an OpenPDU with low budget in a DIY way, or print some custom boards and choose better parts for an overkill experience.

## Getting started
Check the [hardware](HARDWARE) page and the [hardware compatibility list](HCL) page before acquiring the needed hardware.
At the moment (we're still in alpha) there's no download available but we're working on it. We're setting up an automated build server that'll create the images to download automatically.
You can also check the [software](SOFTWARE) page for more informations about the features.

## Getting involved
Please refer to our [github project page](https://github.com/openpdu) for more informations.
